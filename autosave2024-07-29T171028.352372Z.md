# Even our mathjax implementation consist of sub & super script implementation, See below:

$$ CO_2 $$

m$

$$ E=MC^2 $$

# But, it renders only when wrote from first line...

Not working here: $$ CO_2  MC^2 $$

# Super Script:

This is an example of super-script: E = MC^2^

​ 

# Sub Script:

This is an example of sub-script: CO~2~
